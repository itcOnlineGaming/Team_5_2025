# Purpose:
#   Build the Svelte frontend and run:
#     - Optional Vitest unit/component tests (if Vitest is installed)
#     - Playwright E2E tests in tests
#   Triggered on pushes to main and manual runs.
#
# Assumptions:
#   - Frontend project is in ./frontend
#   - Uses npm with package-lock.json
#   - Vite preview runs on port 4173
#   - Playwright tests are in frontend/tests (adjust if needed)
#   - If a project does not use Vitest or Playwright, the relevant steps will skip gracefully.

    steps:
      # 1) Check out the repository code
      #    This pulls the repository contents into the runner.
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # If your repo uses Git submodules, uncomment:
        # with:
        #   submodules: "true"
        #   # Use a PAT only if GITHUB_TOKEN cannot access private submodules:
        #   # token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}


      # 2) Set up Node.js with dependency caching
      #    - Uses Node 20
      #    - Caches npm metadata based on frontend/package-lock.json
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: |
            Mood-Tracker/package-lock.json


      # 3) Install project dependencies for the frontend
      #    - Uses npm ci for deterministic, lockfile-based installs.
      - name: Install dependencies
        working-directory: Mood-Tracker
        run: npm ci


      # 4) Cache Playwright browsers to avoid re-downloading on every run
      #    - Stores browser binaries under ~/.cache/ms-playwright
      #    - Keyed on OS and package-lock.json (update cache when deps change).
      - name: Cache Playwright browsers
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-${{ hashFiles('Mood-Tracker/package-lock.json') }}


      # 5) Install Playwright browsers (and OS deps)
      #    - If browsers are cached, this is a quick no-op.
      #    - If @playwright/test is not installed, this will fail; that is expected
      #      for projects that declare Playwright but misconfigure dependencies.
      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        working-directory: Mood-Tracker
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps


      # 6) Build the Svelte app for production
      #    - Ensures the app compiles before running tests against it.
      - name: Build app
        working-directory: Mood-Tracker
        run: npm run build


      # 7) Start a Vite preview server in the background
      #    - Serves the built app on port 4173.
      #    - --host 0.0.0.0 binds to all interfaces (safe on the runner).
      #    - Writes the server PID one level up (repo root) as ../preview.pid.
      - name: Start preview server
        working-directory: Mood-Tracker
        run: |
          npm run preview -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173 &
          echo $! > ../preview.pid


      # 8) Wait until the preview port is open before running tests
      #    - Uses "wait-on" via npx without adding it to package.json.
      #    - We probe the TCP port only (no hard-coded base path), so this works
      #      for any app that listens on 4173 regardless of its URL structure.
      - name: Wait for preview to be ready
        run: npx -y wait-on tcp:127.0.0.1:4173


      # 9) Run Playwright E2E tests
      #     - Assumes Playwright tests are located in frontend/tests.
      #     - Uses:
      #         - "list" reporter for concise CI output
      #         - "html" reporter to generate ./playwright-report for artifact upload
      #     - Adjust "tests" if your project uses a different directory.
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        working-directory: Mood-Tracker
        env:
          CI: 'true'  # Many tools (including Playwright) use this to enable CI-safe defaults.
        run: npx playwright test


      # 10) Stop the preview server (always runs, even if tests fail)
      #     - The PID file was created in the repo root as ../preview.pid.
      #     - We read it, attempt to kill the process, then clean up the file.
      - name: Stop preview server
        if: always()
        working-directory: .
        run: |
          if [ -f preview.pid ]; then
            kill "$(cat preview.pid)" || true
            rm -f preview.pid
          fi


      # 11) Upload Playwright HTML report as a CI artifact
      #     - Allows inspection of E2E results (especially on failure).
      #     - Path must match the reporter output directory:
      #         - default for "html" reporter is ./playwright-report
      #         - here resolved as frontend/playwright-report from repo root.
      #     - if-no-files-found: ignore prevents failure when no report exists
      #       (e.g., if Playwright is not used in a given project).
      - name: Upload Playwright report
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: Mood-Tracker/playwright-report
          if-no-files-found: ignore
